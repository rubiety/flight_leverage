title: Mileage Running to Top Elite in Two Weeks
---

This is more of a thought experiment than anything else, but it's interesting to me that with some ingenuity and luck with cheap trans-Pacific fares, it should be possible to acheive United 1K in two short weeks for about $4,500.

One of the most popular destinations for long-haul mileage running in Singapore, due to 1) intense competition from various carriers at SIN, and 2) it being so darn far away from the United States.

Recently a EWR-SIN fare popped up with fairly liberal routing rules for $1098. With some creative routing, you can squeak about 22,500 miles out of this. Put in four of those and a creatively-routed transcontinental, and there you are sitting on 1K. Should be easily doable within two weeks.
