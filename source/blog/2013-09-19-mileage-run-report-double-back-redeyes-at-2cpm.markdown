title: "Mileage Run Report: Double Back Redy-eyes at 2CPM"

This article was jointly written by [Sean Meehan of Freak Went Flying](http://www.freakwentflying.com) and [Ben Hughes of Flight Leverage](http://www.flightleverage.com) and appears jointly.

### Introduction:

When a $58 one-way fare from Las Vegas to Boston comes up, it's really hard to pass up, even if doing so creates a brutally tiresome mileage run. Back in April when this fare was active, I convinced Sean to book two consecutive with me on this fare: a red-eye departing Las Vegas, returning back just in time to catch another red-eye. With about 48 hours hopping airports, our routing over was: LAS-IAH-BOS-EWR-IAH-LAS-EWR-BOS-IAH-LAS. I'm always up for some extreme flying, and in this case the double red-eye-and-returns yielded 2.0 CPM, my lowest ever.

My goal flying this was to earn over 11,300 EQM towards US Airways Chairman's Preferred status (having already hit United 1K earlier this year), leaving me an interesting position: I'd have to leave my UA FF# on the reservation as long as possible - to clear upgrades as a 1K - then subsequently switch the FF# to US Airways and then check in. When doing that, my seats are effectively fixed, since Star Golds on United don't even have access to choose an Economy Plus seat. In the process of flying at 2.0 CPM, I'm effectively buying redeemable miles at 1 cent per mile with my 2x multiplier as Chairman's.

### Flight/Lounge/Meetup Reports:




### Conclusion:

At 10PM Wednesday we finally landed in Vegas after ten flights covering 11,300 miles, leaving an airport only once to explore Boston. While the first red-eye was pretty brutal, overall we held up well. Having lounge access so many places (two with showers) certainly helped, flying with a friend always makes the journey more interesting, and getting to meet up with some other travelers was awesome. Sean and I had a blast on our 48 hour brutal mileage run, and I'd do it again in an instant!
