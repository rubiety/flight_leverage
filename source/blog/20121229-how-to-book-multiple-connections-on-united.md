title: How to Book Multiple Connections on United.com
---

Recently some dissapointing news arose that United.com is no longer showing multiple-connection itineraries by default. The two major implications of this as I can see are:

1. The lowest fare may not show.
2. Mileage runners have greater difficulty booking multiple-connection flights.

Typically when I compose a mileage run, I do up-front research and determination of routes using ITA Matrix, then go over to United.com to find the same route. While sometimes this isn't possible when booking a round trip, usually it's at least possible with two one-way fares. With the new restriction in place, this may not be possible for some routes. So how do you book multiple-connection itineraries on United?

One way around this I've been using is to - after doing up-front research on ITA Matrix - search for the flight in Hipmunk. As [] shows, Hipmunk is actually built on ITA Matrix and you can enter advanced routing codes after the source and destination airport codes by adding them after "::". You'll see upon typing this that Hipmunk even gives a drop-down of useful codes (which is by no means exhaustive).

So for example if you wanted to book a flight SAN-SFO-EWR-PHL (as I did recently) even though that routing doesn't show on United.com, go to Hipmunk and search as follows:

Source: SAN::SFO EWR
Destination: PHL::EWR SFO

These routing codes after the "::" instruct Hipmunk to only show routes with both SFO and EWR as connection points. After getting the results, you should get a link to book directly on United.com which should take you right to the purchase page, effectively circumventing searching for this particular routing (and failing) on United.com.
