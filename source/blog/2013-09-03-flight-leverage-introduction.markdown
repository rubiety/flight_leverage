title: "New Blog: Flight Leverage Introduction"
---

Friends who follow my travel escapades have long said I should start a blog, but I've resisted: there's a wealth of other resources with great contet, and I was never sure I contribute beyond all the other great blogs out there.

Since leaving my home in May and becoming a travel-full-time digital nomad, I've been immersed in the travel world and have focused on leveraging as much travel value as I can. Coming up with interesting travel hacks has become my passion. Sharing my thoughts, tips, and experiences seems to make sense, and I think now's the right time to start.

### There are a few reasons why I think I bring a unique angle to travel hacking:

* **My academic background is economics**: I bring an analytical approach to miles/points and flights, always cognizant of trade-offs, opportunity cost, and the importance of resisting bias.
* **I write computer software**: I apply an engineering mindset to most problems, love tinkering, and am passionate about learning how things work. I think there's a surprising amount of cross-over between curious softare engineers and travel hackers.
* **I'm a [digital nomad](http://travel.benhughes.name)**: I travel full time, so travel decisions affect me every day. In order to survive without running out of money, I have to leverage small amounts of money lots of travel.
* **I find extreme flying invigorating**: I mileage-run primarily for redeemable miles on less-than 3.0 CPM fares. This year I'll fly on about 150,000 miles of mileage runs, in the process hitting United 1K, US Airways Chairman's Preferred, and American ExecutivePlatinum for 2013.
* **I travel with a [stuffed penguin](http://jettingpenguin.com)**: you can always expect a healthy dose of sillyness, and some random penguin pictures. I am proud to help flightless birds become less flightless.

### My approach to travel blogging will be different:

* **No Monetization**: I have no intention of ever monetizing this blog with ads or affiliate links, at least not for a while. I make my living as a software developer, and to the extent a reader might have project work for me in the future, that's monetezation enough.
* **No Credit Cards**: I don't find the "credit card game" to be particularly interesting. I prefer to earn miles from actual BIS flying, and I won't ever have anything to say about credit cards.
* **Low Throughput, High Quality**: Fewer articles, each one of higher quality.
* **Open Source**: This entire blog is completely [open sourced on GitHub](http://github.com/rubiety/flight_leverage). Nothing is hidden except my deployment credentials.

### Here's a preview of some articles you can expect over the next few months:

* Mileage Running as a Hobby
* Hyatt Diamond Challenge for United Golds and Above
* Flying Thai Airways 747 First Class for $79
* Mileage Run Report: Double-Back Red-Eyes at 2.0 CPM
* Increasing, then Decreasing Marginal Return of Miles
* Mileage Running to United 1K, US Chairman's, and American ExecutivePlatinum in One Year
* Staying Classy in International First Class with a T-Shirt and a Stuffed Penguin
* Fifth Freedom Routes for Bargain International First Class
* Tracking your Miles as a Financial Asset on Mint.com
* Trip Report: First Class Extravaganza in Asia

I'm looking forward to writing about my favorite hobby. I hope you enjoy the content!
