title: Stretched Redemptions on United Miles
---

Here was my stretched redemption, involving two free layovers, a 4 day stopover in Seoul, and a double open jaw (both at the source and the destination). This was all considered one round-trip redemption on United for 62,500 miles in Economy:

LAX-NRT (22hr "Layover", visited Tokyo), NRT-BKK (20hr "Layover"), BKK-CNX
Open Jaw (Unflown Segment)
SIN-ICN (4 day Stopover in Seoul), ICN-LAX-SAN
