title: Hotel Shuttles are a Ghetto
---

We desperately need the "Uber for Hotel Shuttles".

As a nomad, I stay very frequently a hotels, often for just one night a week.
Hotel-going over the past year or so has earned me Starwood Platinum, Hyatt
Diamond, IHG Gold, and Marriott Gold statuses. I also hold extremely
high standards for myself and those around me, particularly if I'm paying a lot
of money for a service.

As such, I think pretty often about my experiences with airlines and hotels and
how they could be better. Overall I think that the airlines have done a pretty
good job - within the inherent economic and technical constraints in the
industry - of innovating. Hotels, not so much.

My most hated aspect of hotels - by far - is hotel "courtesy" shuttles. 

...

What's most infuriating about shuttles is how much better they could be - and
how much better I think off-airport hotels would do (compared to their
on-airport counterparts) if a better system existed.

One response is to simply say that consumers don't care enough about shuttles
for my "cost of time" argument to hold water. But relative prices tell a
different story: why are on-airport hotels so much more expensive than off
airport hotels? Consumers are simply willing to pay a premium to be near the
airport and avoid the time waste . 

I'm convinced that if consumers knew with
near-certainty that once curbside they'd be picked up within five minutes and at
the hotel five minutes later, behavior would change. The *total cost* (cost of
hotel plus inprecise time & uncertainty costs) of staying at an off-airport
hotel would decline relative to on-airport hotels.

So, "Uber for Hotel Shuttles", where are you? Get on that, Silicon Valley!
