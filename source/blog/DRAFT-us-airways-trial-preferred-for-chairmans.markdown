title: US Airways Trial Preferred for Chairman's Preferred Status
---

Although you can start at Silver and fly enough miles to hit any of the tiers, it might be worthwhile paying the extra $200 for Gold status up-front. Firstly, having Gold will put you above the (presumably plentiful) Silvers for upgrades. You'll still be behind most of the other golds (since after status, US Airways looks at miles flown), though while I was US Airways Gold, I was pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded 75% of the time. Second and perhaps more importantly, buying Gold will give you three months of Star Alliance Gold status, which comes with a number of benefits while traveling internationally, such as business class check-in (skipping the often massive check-in lines), priority boarding, and lounge access. When I did Trial Preferred last fall, I bought Gold shortly before a large international trip which got me access to the Star Alliance lounge at LAX, the ANA Business Lounge in Tokyo Narita, the Thai Royal Orchid lounge in Bankok and Chiang Mai, the Singapore Airlines lounge in Singapore, and the Asiana lounge in Seoul. Having access to those lounges and skipping the lengthy check-in lines (where frustratingly, outside the country it's impossible to check-in at a kiosk and beon your way without interacting with an agent) was well worth the extra $200. Aside from all this, you'll get an additional 25% mile bonus on those miles flown until you'd otherwise hit Gold, and those miles are worth something too.
