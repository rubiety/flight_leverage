title: Flight Review - First Class on the Emirates A380
---

Amidst a recent trip I did to Asia on a stretched United redemption, I spotted an opportunity to fulfill one of my long-time dreams: fly first class on the Emirates A380. Typically priced quite high ($20,000 or more for a round trip from New York to Dubai), and knowing Emirates lack of alliance made it difficult to acquire on miles, I knew I had to take advantage of the opportunity.

Emirates operates a few little-known "tag routes" in their network on the A380, including a Bangkok to Hong Kong flight that's only three hours long. While checking fares for various airlines on this (most around $200 one-way in Economy), I happened to notice that the *first class* fare on the Emirates A380 was only $640! Though still about three times that of economy, I just couldn't resist thought of sampling what is arguably the best first class experience in the world on "BlingAir" for far less than $1,000.

This was the most highly anticipated flight of my life, and I was actually a little nervous on my way to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport (I had very high expectations of the experience, and didn't want to be let down). 

The experience started with the first class check-in line, which was quick and smooth. The agent gave me a special "Emirates First" tag for my backpack (a nice souvenir), and a priority security line pass, which ended up being the same separate line the airline crews go through. That line was extremely fast with it's own dedicated immigration officials, and I was through both security and immigration in under three minutes.

Having deliberately arrived early, I went straight down to the Emirates Lounge, which was completely empty. Unlike many lounges, there was no separate section for First Class, and the loung was fairly small, but it was quite nice with a very nice spread of food and alcohol. 

After some time relaxing there, I left early to go get some pictures of the plane (this was my second time on an A380, after flying Singapore Airlines in Economy to get over to Asia). Before long, they opened boarding, and it was finally time to be escorted to my private suite.

Walking down the separate aisle up to the upper-deck, a flight attendant at the top looked at my boarding pass and handed me off to another flight attendant, who personally escorted me to my suite (2K, on the right side of the plane) and welcomed be on board. She offered me my choice of beverage, and a chose the 2003 Dom Perignon champagne.


Perhaps the most novel feature of the Emirates A380 - and something entirely unique to their first class product - is the presence of two shower/spa rooms on board.
